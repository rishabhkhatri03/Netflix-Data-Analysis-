# Netflix-Data-Analysis-
Performed an in-depth analysis of Netflix data using Python. The project highlights how to derive valuable insights from large datasets by leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities. The repository includes the dataset, detailed code, visualizations, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.
Netflix Data Analysis with Python
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset to extract meaningful insights about content trends, user preferences, and platform behaviors. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis dives deep into various metrics to understand the streaming giant's content distribution and trends.

Key Features
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data type conversions, and filtering irrelevant information.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns, relationships, and trends within the dataset.
Visualizations: Creating insightful visual representations using bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and more to illustrate key findings.
Content Analysis: Analyzing popular genres, release years, and runtime distributions.
Trend Analysis: Investigating trends in content additions over time and regional availability.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for this analysis.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and efficient handling of arrays.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating detailed visualizations to represent the data.
